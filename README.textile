h1. XEN:Deploy

A collection of recipes, tasks, and strategies for managing non-rails applications specifically WordPress, WP-MU and BuddyPress.

This software should be considered _alpha_ and not used for anything usefulâ€¦ yet.

h2. Install

<code>gem install xendeploy</code>

*Dependencies*

*capistrano*
Obviously. :)

*capistrano-ext*
For doing multistage configurations

h3. Use

XEN:Deploy ships with its own capify script. This script should be run from the root of your application. It will create a standard enough Capfile, but put the deploy.rb script in "_assets/" instead of config.

h4. Configuration

Configure your deployment in deploy.rb, setting the values of the symbols there-in.
