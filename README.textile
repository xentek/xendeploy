*Dependencies*

*railsless-deploy*
For making the default tasks a bit more app agnostic.
<code>gem install railsless-deploy -s http://gemcutter.org</code>

*capistrano-ext*
For doing multistage configurations

h3. Use

XEN:Deploy ships with its own capify script. This script should be run from the root of your application. It will create a standard enough Capfile, but put the deploy.rb script in "_assets/" instead of config.

h4. Configuration

Configure your deployment in deploy.rb, setting the values of the symbols there-in.
